# Reactify TensorFlow.js Real-Time Object Detection 

This is a simple sample to play with TensorFlow.js and trying to real-time object detection with this machine learning platform.

### Build & Run 

For this practice, I used Create React App for simplicity.

To run the application in dev mode 

``` 
yarn install
yarn start
```

PS: YARN or NPM working simpler, it matter of your personal choice.
